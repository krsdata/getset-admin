           </div> 
           
<p>This Privacy Notice describes how members of the JUSTKHELO group (known as "we", "us", "our" or "JUSTKHELO") treat the information and data you provide to us so we can manage your relationship with JUSTKHELO. In accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will process any personal information that you provide to us or that is otherwise in our possession relating to you. The JUSTKHELO website (the "Website"), telephone calls, and any other means of providing information are acceptable. This Privacy Policy requires you to acknowledge your understanding of and approval of the use of personal information as described here. Using this Website or providing us with any personal information is not permitted if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

 <h2 class="heading line">PURPOSE & <span> USAGE</span></h2>
            
            <p>To avail of certain Services on the Portal, Users would be required to provide certain information for the registration process namely:
<ol class="paragraph-Pp">
<li>Username</strong></li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Email address </li>
<li>Mobile Number </li>
<li>Date of Birth</li>  
 </ol>

<p>You may be required to provide additional information, such as your Permanent Account Number, as part of the process of obtaining access to the Services and to use the features offered through the Portal.
 You may also provide us with Sensitive Personal Information ("SPI") on the portal in certain circumstances. SPI means such personal information which consists of information relating to your physical, physiological, and mental health condition; medical records and history; biometric information, sexual orientation, and financial information, such as information regarding the payment instrument/modes used by you to make such payments, which may include cardholder name, credit/debit card number (in encrypted form) with an expiration date, banking details, wallet details, etc. During the payment process, you will be provided with this information in order to facilitate your payment process.</p>

<p>JUSTKHELO does not collect any other SPI in the course of providing the Services, aside from any financial information you choose to provide when making payment for any Services on the Portal. Unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy, or as provided in a separate written agreement between you and JUSTKHELO, or as required by law, SPI collected by JUSTKHELO will not be disclosed to any third party. The information on the Portal in relation to you that is publicly available, including SPI, will not be covered by this condition.
In the course of providing the Services, Users also have the option of inviting other existing users or other users ("Invited Users") to utilize any of the Services by providing their email address. After receiving this information, JUSTKHELO may contact the Invited User and invite him or her to register with JUSTKHELO (if such Invited User is not already an existing User) and participate in the Game to which he or she has been invited. Participants in any of the Games shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions for use of the Portal. In this case, the User represents that the Invited Users have consented and agreed to the disclosure and use of their email addresses.</p>

 <p>The required information is specific to the kind of Game/Services the User wishes to participate in, access, and will be utilized in order to provide services, including but not limited to the Services requested by the User. We use the information supplied by the Users in order to provide you with a user-friendly game experience and to improve the Services.</p>

<p>In limited circumstances, JUSTKHELO may also share this information with affiliates and third parties, including to provide services requested by the User, to comply with legal processes, to prevent fraud and to ensure the security of our network and services.</p>

</p>

<h2 class="heading line">Disclosure/ <span>Sharing</span></h2>
        
          
            <p>The company may also share information provided by you and data concerning use of the services and participation in the games with third party service providers engaged by the company for the purpose of data analytics or other similar purposes, for storing, improving the services or otherwise helping JUSTKHELO better serve you.
We will ensure that you are notified if we plan to use your personal information (that is, information that can be used to identify the User and that is not otherwise publicly available) for any other purpose. Furthermore, you will have the option to withhold or withdraw your consent for any use other than those above.
The information you enter into the Portal is collected, used, and stored by JUSTKHELO. The information collected hereunder may be shared, disclosed, and transferred with the affiliates of JUSTKHELO. Consumer information may be included among the business assets that are shared, disclosed, or transferred when JUSTKHELO sells or transfers its business assets. Hereby, you expressly grant JUSTKHELO permission to disclose and transfer your information to such third parties. For game-related marketing and promotional purposes, and other purposes related to user engagement, JustKhelo may share information and data that you provide to the company with its commercial partners. Furthermore, JUSTKHELO reserves the right to disclose personal information as required by law in accordance with duly authorized legal processes, government requests, and as necessary to protect the rights and interests of JUSTKHELO.

</p>

 <h2 class="heading line">Use of <span> Cookies</span></h2>
         
           
            <p>User identification (User ID) is used in order to understand a user's individual interests based on the computer identifier in order to improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal. Cookies are used in this process. If a User does not voluntarily identify himself/herself (e.g., by registering), JUSTKHELO cannot identify the User, even if we assign a cookie to the computer of the User. The only information a cookie can contain is the information provided by the User. Users' hard drives cannot be read by a cookie. JUSTKHELO advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the user clicks on their ads), a process that Sportsfight does not control.
            </p>

            <p>When a User visits the Portal, the JustKHELO web servers automatically collect limited information about the User's computer's connection to the Internet, such as the User's IP address. (An IP address is the digital address that lets computers connected to the Internet know how and to where to send data to User, such as web pages viewed by User). IP addresses do not identify a User personally. This information is used by JUSTKHELO to deliver web pages when users request them, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal, and to inform advertisers of the geographical locations from which JUSTKHELO visitors come.</p>

            <h2 class="heading line">JUSTKHELO <span>LINKS</span></h2>
          
            <p>There are also links to other websites on JUSTKHELO. Sites like these have their own privacy policies, which are beyond JUSTKHELO's control. When the User leaves the JUSTKHELO servers (the User can determine where they are by checking the URL displayed in the location bar on the User's browser), the use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policies of the site that the User is visiting. Those policies may differ from those of JUSTKHELO. If the user is unable to find the privacy policies of any of these sites on the site's homepage, the user may contact the site directly for more information. JustKHELO is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such websites.

            </p>

             <h2 class="heading line">Security<span>Procedures</span></h2>
         
            <p>Data collected by JUSTKHELO is securely stored in a JUSTKHELO-controlled database. The database is stored on servers protected by a firewall; access to these servers is password-protected and based on a need-to-know basis. As effective as our security measures are, we understand no system is impenetrable. So, we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply won't be intercepted as it is transmitted to us over the Internet. Additionally, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access. By using the Portal, you agree that your information may be used or transferred outside of India.</p>
<p>JUSTKHELO also believes that the internet is an ever-evolving medium. Periodically, we may review and update our privacy policy to incorporate any future changes as we deem appropriate, without notifying you. We will always use the information we gather in accordance with the policy under which it was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page, so you will always know what information we collect, how we use it, how we store it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
</p>
     <h2 class="heading line">Adver<span>tising</span></h2>
          
            <p>As part of its advertising program, JUSTKHELO tends to provide its advertisers with information regarding traffic to various pages of its site as a means of enabling them to understand the value of advertising on the Portal. JUSTKHELO contacts you from time to time about updating your content to provide you with features that may benefit you.

</p>
<p>There may or may not be several deceptive emails, websites, blogs, etc. claiming to be from or associated with JUSTKHELO circulating online. Our logo, photos, links, content, and other information is often included in these emails, websites, blogs, etc. In some emails, websites, blogs, etc., the user is asked for login information, a password, or that the user has won a prize, or they are asked to provide methods to commit an illegal/unauthorized act/deed, etc request detailed personal information or a payment of some kind. These emails, websites, blogs, etc., and accompanying materials are not affiliated with JUSTKHELO in any way. Please do not respond to emails or use websites, blogs, etc. for your own protection. In the future, we may use any information you provide to JUSTKHELO, including your email address or phone number, to contact you about the services you have used or to provide you with information about updated services.
</p>
 <h2 class="heading line">Conditions <span>of Use</span></h2>
